            I’m a 17-year-old software engineering student with a strong passion for coding and technology. Over the years, I have developed a solid foundation in front-end web development, mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create engaging and responsive websites. I’m also proficient in programming languages such as C, C++, Python, PHP, and frameworks like React, which allow me to build dynamic and scalable applications.

            My journey into programming began with a curiosity for how software works, and this curiosity has driven me to continuously learn and improve my skills. I enjoy solving challenging problems, writing clean and efficient code, and collaborating on projects that push my boundaries 
            
            Aside from technical skills, I value creativity, attention to detail, and effective communication — all of which are crucial when designing intuitive user experiences and writing maintainable code. As I continue my studies and grow as a developer, my goal is to contribute to meaningful projects that make a difference and to keep evolving with the ever-changing world of technology.
            
            I’m excited about the future of software development and look forward to applying my skills in real-world environments, whether through internships, open-source contributions, or personal projects.
